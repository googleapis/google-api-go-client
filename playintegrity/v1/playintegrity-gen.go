// Package playintegrity provides access to the Google Play Integrity API.
//
// For product documentation, see: https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity
//
// # Library status
//
// These client libraries are officially supported by Google. However, this
// library is considered complete and is in maintenance mode. This means
// that we will address critical bugs and security issues but will not add
// any new features.
//
// When possible, we recommend using our newer
// [Cloud Client Libraries for Go](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go)
// that are still actively being worked and iterated on.
//
// # Creating a client
//
// Usage example:
//
//	import "google.golang.org/api/playintegrity/v1"
//	...
//	ctx := context.Background()
//	playintegrityService, err := playintegrity.NewService(ctx)
//
// In this example, Google Application Default Credentials are used for
// authentication. For information on how to create and obtain Application
// Default Credentials, see https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials.
//
// # Other authentication options
//
// To use an API key for authentication (note: some APIs do not support API
// keys), use [google.golang.org/api/option.WithAPIKey]:
//
//	playintegrityService, err := playintegrity.NewService(ctx, option.WithAPIKey("AIza..."))
//
// To use an OAuth token (e.g., a user token obtained via a three-legged OAuth
// flow, use [google.golang.org/api/option.WithTokenSource]:
//
//	config := &oauth2.Config{...}
//	// ...
//	token, err := config.Exchange(ctx, ...)
//	playintegrityService, err := playintegrity.NewService(ctx, option.WithTokenSource(config.TokenSource(ctx, token)))
//
// See [google.golang.org/api/option.ClientOption] for details on options.
